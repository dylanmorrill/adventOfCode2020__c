# Advent of Code 2020 (in Apex)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual holiday-themeed series of coding challlanges, starting on Dec 1, and ending on Dec 25. In 2020, I decided to take a stab at solving the challanges in Apex.

I coded up to week 11, and then got sidetracked with other things.

- Week 1
  - Code
  - stuff
- Week 2
