# Advent of Code 2020 (in Apex)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual holiday-themeed series of coding challlanges, starting on Dec 1, and ending on Dec 25. In 2020, I decided to take a stab at solving the challanges in Apex.

I coded up to week 10, and then got sidetracked with other things.

## Two important notes
1. Most of these challenges receive the challange input via static resource I created. The classes have a custom parser for that static resource input. I forgot to include those in this repository, and the sandbox they were created in has since been refreshed. 
2. My code probably became increasingly less-elegant as the challenges go on (weird spacing, debug statements, etc, etc). This code was just for fun, and doesn't represent anything I would ever try to get near a production system.
